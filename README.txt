| METAFONT BOOK - the missing figures |
=======================================

This project is to remake, reverse engineer all figures missing from Donald Knuth's Metafont Book we can find online as a PDF.
It would make much easier the accessibility to the software and will help to know where to start or locate parameters one is looking for.
Please contribute with the figures you might have already done yourself.
